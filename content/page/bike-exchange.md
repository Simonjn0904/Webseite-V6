You’re super keen to join a social ride but don’t have a suitable bike right now? 🚴‍♀ You want to try out riding a road bike a few times before committing to buying one? 💸 Your bike just got stolen and your cycling date next week is suddenly at risk? 😬
Then check out our Bike Exchange! Browse the list of available bikes in your size, contact the person offering one, and arrange when to pick it up and bring it back. 🌟

This idea came out of conversations with people in our community: many have two or three great bikes sitting in the garage, while for others, the cost of entry into cycling is a major barrier. That means cycling often ends up being something only accessible to those who can afford it – excluding many, and reinforcing elitism and social bubbles within the sport.We want to push back against that and offer a real, practical alternative. ✊🚲

But to make it work, we need your help! If you’ve got a bike you’d be willing to lend out, please add it to the list.
And: spread the word! We know that most people in this group already own bikes – so tell your friends, flatmates, or colleagues who might be interested. Share the link if they’re looking for a bike!
