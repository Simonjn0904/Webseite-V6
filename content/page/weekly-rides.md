# Social Ride ☀️🚴‍♂️

📌 Uferstraße 4, Heidelberg  
⏰ Every Saturday, 10:30

We run a weekly social ride every Saturday, with the emphasis on social: the tempo is relaxed and conversational 🗣️, the vibes are impeccable ✨, and most importantly we usually finish with a café stop ☕. We especially welcome those who are new to cycling 🆕, riding a gravel bike 🚵‍♂️, or not comfortable in more performance-focused cycling groups. The pace will be set to ensure that the slowest rider can enjoy the ride without feeling like they have to hang on for dear life 🐢. The route is announced each week on the WhatsApp Annoucements group📱. 

# Fast Ride ⚡🚴‍♀️

📌 Uferstraße 4, Heidelberg  
⏰ Every Sunday, 10:30


We will challenge each other on specific sections of the course 💨, but regroup after each one 🤝. Riders should feel comfortable and safe drafting and riding in a group 🌀, but apart from that there is no "speed requirement" to join 🚫🏁. Whether you join is more about wanting to engage in some friendly competition rather than how fast you are! 🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️💪

There will always be someone leading the ride 👋, ensuring that everyone is comfortable, both with the pace and the group. We’ll alternate between the Rheindamm route 🌊 and some more hilly courses ⛰️, but the general format remains the same: we race each other across the route and ride at a fast but comfortable pace for everyone 🏁. We take care of each other even at higher speeds and elevated lactate levels 🧬😉. The ride finishes together – no one gets dropped or left alone halfway 🫂.
