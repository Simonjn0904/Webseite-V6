# ✨🦕 Welcome to the Dinos! 🦖✨

We are a community of young cyclists organising weekly rides and regular off-the-bike socials, as well as larger cycling events. In doing so, we aim to create a space where everyone - regardless of fitness level, experience, or equipment - can enjoy cycling. For us, the focus is on the social side of things.
Our goal is to build an inclusive group, striving to provide a safer space from discrimination, where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome! 🚴‍♀🚴‍♂🚴🚴‍
